class ChangesMixin(object):
    """
    ChangesMixin keeps track of changes for model instances.

    It allows you to retrieve the following states from an instance:

    1. current_state()
        The current state of the instance.
    2. previous_state()
        The state of the instance **after** it was created, saved
        or deleted the last time.
    3. old_state()
        The previous previous_state(), i.e. the state of the
        instance **before** it was created, saved or deleted the
        last time.

    It also provides convenience methods to get changes between states:

    1. changes()
        Changes from previous_state to current_state.
    2. previous_changes()
        Changes from old_state to previous_state.
    3. old_changes()
        Changes from old_state to current_state.

    And the following methods to determine if an instance was/is persisted in
    the database:

    1. was_persisted()
        Was the instance persisted in its old state.
    2. is_persisted()
        Is the instance is_persisted in its current state.

    This schematic tries to illustrate how these methods relate to
    each other::
